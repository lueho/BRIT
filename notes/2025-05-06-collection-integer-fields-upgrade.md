# Collection Model: Integer Field Upgrade and Test/Codebase Cleanup (2025-05-06)

## Summary
This note documents the recent migration and codebase improvements related to the `min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant` field in the `Collection` model, as well as associated test and code cleanup. All changes are now production-ready and tested.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Model Changes
- `Collection.min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant` is now a `PositiveIntegerField` (was previously a decimal field).
    - Accepts only whole numbers (liters/person).
    - All forms, serializers, and filters updated accordingly.
- All model, form, and serializer docstrings have been reviewed and expanded for clarity.

### 2. Form & Serializer Updates
- `CollectionModelForm` and `CollectionModelSerializer` now strictly handle integer values for this field.
- All help texts and labels updated to reflect integer-only logic.
- Docstrings and comments cleaned up for maintainability.

### 3. Filter & Renderer Adjustments
- `MinTonVolumePerInhabitantRangeFilter` now uses integer steps and default ranges.
- All related filter widgets and CSV/XLSX renderers updated to expect and output integer values.

### 4. Test Suite
- All tests (forms, serializers, views, filters, renderers) updated:
    - No tests submit or expect decimal values for `min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant`.
    - Assertions and test data use integers only.
    - All tests pass as of this update.
- Test code cleaned up for style and readability (PEP8, consistent quoting, line breaks).

### 5. Codebase Cleanup
- Removed obsolete comments, logs, and legacy code in all touched files.
- Added or expanded docstrings for all major classes and methods affected.
- Ensured all code is ready for production: no debug statements, all logic consistent and documented.

---

## Migration & Compatibility
- No fake or mock data introduced outside of tests.
- No changes to database structure except for the integer field migration.
- All legacy data should be checked for non-integer values before migration (manual check recommended if upgrading from a decimal field).

---

## Next Steps
- If further changes to container size/volume logic are needed, update this note and create/modify an ADR in `notes/02_design_decisions/`.
- Remove or mark this note as completed once all related deployment and documentation is finalized.

## Related Files
- `case_studies/soilcom/models.py`, `forms.py`, `serializers.py`, `filters.py`, `views.py`
- All test files: `tests/test_forms.py`, `tests/test_serializers.py`, `tests/test_filters.py`, `tests/test_renderers.py`

---

**All logic and documentation now reflects the integer-only requirement for minimum container volume per inhabitant.**

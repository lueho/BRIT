# BRIT Website Analysis Notes

## Website Structure and Navigation
- The website is organized into several main sections: Maps, Materials, Sources, Inventories, Bibliography, Learning, and About
- Navigation is provided through a sidebar menu and a topbar
- The site appears to be built using Django with a Bootstrap-based admin template (sb-admin-2)
- Login/registration functionality is available but not required for basic browsing

## Design Observations
- The design is clean but somewhat basic, using the default sb-admin-2 template styling
- Color scheme is primarily light with blue accents
- Icons are used in the sidebar navigation for visual cues
- Module cards on the homepage provide visual navigation to main sections
- Limited custom styling beyond the base template

## Mobile Responsiveness Issues
- The site has a viewport meta tag for responsive design
- There is a mobile toggle button in the topbar template
- Media queries exist in brit.css for responsive tables
- However, during testing, mobile media queries weren't active
- No hamburger menu was found in mobile view despite code existing for it
- The sidebar may not collapse properly on mobile devices

## Repository Structure
- Django project with modules corresponding to website sections
- Uses Bootstrap-based sb-admin-2 template
- Static assets organized in standard folders (css, js, img)
- Template structure uses partials for components like sidebar and topbar
- Custom brit.css file with some responsive design media queries

## Technical Implementation
- Bootstrap 4 is the primary CSS framework
- jQuery is used for JavaScript functionality
- FontAwesome is used for icons
- Limited custom JavaScript beyond the template
- Some responsive design attempts but potentially incomplete implementation

## Areas for Improvement
- Mobile responsiveness needs significant work
- Visual design could be modernized beyond the basic admin template
- Navigation could be improved for better user experience
- More visual hierarchy and whitespace in content areas
- Better use of color and typography to create visual interest
- Potential for more interactive elements and modern UI components

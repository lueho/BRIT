# 2024-05-30: Dropdown Menu Visibility Fix

## Context
Dropdown menus in the card footer were not displaying their children after recent CSS modernization efforts. The issue persisted despite correct HTML and context, and was confirmed to be caused by CSS, not template logic.

## Problem
- `.card` and `.card-footer` had `overflow: hidden;` (or similar restrictive overflow), which prevented the `.dropdown-menu` from being visible outside the card/footer boundaries.
- Flex utilities (`.d-flex`) were also being overridden by custom CSS, but this was fixed in an earlier step.

## Solution
- Removed or commented out `overflow: hidden;` from `.card` and `.card-footer` in `brit.css`.
- Ensured `.card-footer.d-flex` only applies flex styles when `.d-flex` is present, restoring Bootstrap utility compatibility.

## Result
Dropdown menus in the card footer now display their children/options as intended.

## Next Steps
- Continue with the original workflow and further UI modernization, ensuring custom CSS does not interfere with expected Bootstrap/JS behaviors.
- Summarize this session in the project notes for future reference.

# Documentation Improvement Plan (2025-05-02)

This working note tracks the plan for improving and expanding the BRIT project documentation. The goal is to ensure all user, developer, operations, design, and reference documentation is complete, discoverable, and up-to-date.

---

## 1. Fill in Placeholders and Stubs
- Expanded each README.md with a section overview, recommended reading order, and links to key subpages.
- Removed or merged empty stubs (e.g., processes_app_plan.md, processes_app_dependencies.md) as needed.

## 2. User Guide
- Polished and clarified the User Guide and How-Tos.
- Removed planning/recommendations from published docs; moved them to notes as plans/reports.
- Updated reading order and removed references to deleted pages.

## 3. Developer Guide
- Improved clarity, formatting, and conciseness of Guidelines, Style Guide, Applications, API, and Architecture docs.
- Ensured all instructions are actionable and up-to-date.

## 4. Operations
- Polished Operations & Deployment Guide and README for clarity and actionable steps.
- Linked to related developer docs.

## 5. Design Decisions (ADRs)
- Clarified ADR README, improved template and instructions.
- Emphasized purpose and process for recording decisions.

## 6. Reference
- Cleaned up README for clarity and brevity.
- Provided accurate links and removed redundancy.

## 7. Cross-Linking and Navigation
- Ensured all internal links are up to date after reorganization.
- Provided clear reading order in each section.

## 8. General Quality
- Removed outdated, redundant, or misplaced content from published docs.

- All planning, recommendations, and analysis are preserved in notes, not in user-facing docs.
- Ready for ongoing maintenance and further enhancements as the project evolves.

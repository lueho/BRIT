# Progress Log: Add minimum ton size and minimum ton volume per inhabitant to Collection model

## 2025-05-05

- Started implementation based on plan in `2025-05-05-add-collection-min-ton-fields-plan.md`.
- Added `min_ton_size` (PositiveIntegerField, liters) and `min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant` (DecimalField, liters/person) to `Collection` model in `case_studies/soilcom/models.py`.
- Next: Create and apply database migration.

## 2025-05-05 (cont.)
- Migration for new fields applied successfully (by user via Docker container).
- Updated:
  - `CollectionSerializer` to include new fields (with correct types and null handling).
  - `CollectionModelForm` and admin to support entry of new fields.
  - `CollectionFilterSet` to allow filtering by new fields, with nullable range sliders.
  - Export renderers (CSV/XLSX) to include new fields in output and headers.
  - Added comment to export tasks for future-proofing.
- Implemented nullable range filters (with slider widgets) for both `min_ton_size` and `min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant` in the filter form.
- Updated and extended tests in:
    - `test_filters.py`: Range and null filtering for both fields.
    - `test_forms.py`: Presence, validation, and null handling for both fields (added).
    - `test_serializers.py`: Serialization and null handling for both fields (added, fixed serializer types).
    - `test_renderers.py`: Exported values and null handling for both fields (added, fixed test logic).
- All filter, form, serializer, and renderer tests pass.
- Progress reviewed and checklist updated.

## TODO (2025-05-05)
- [x] Add tests in `test_forms.py` to check form field presence and validation for `min_ton_size` and `min_ton_volume_per_inhabitant`.
- [x] Add assertions in `test_serializers.py` for correct serialization of the new fields.
- [x] Add assertions in `test_renderers.py` for correct export of the new fields in CSV/XLSX.
- [x] All filter logic and tests updated and passing.

## Final Checklist
- [x] Models, migrations, and admin updated
- [x] Serializers updated and tested
- [x] Forms updated and tested
- [x] Filters and widgets updated and tested
- [x] Export logic updated and tested
- [x] All relevant tests pass
- [x] Notes and documentation updated

## Final Review (2025-05-05)
- All unnecessary comments, code, and logs removed.
- Confirmed no deprecated or obsolete code related to min ton fields remains.
- Documentation and notes finalized for production.

**Ready for push to production.**

**Status:** Implementation and test coverage for nullable ton fields is complete and robust across all layers. Ready for deployment or further review.

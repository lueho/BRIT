# BioResource Inventory Tool (BRIT)

BRIT was developped as the bioresource inventory module of the FLEXIBI DST.
It is used to map bioresources, create material models and run inventories
to support decision making of bioresource management. 

## The FLEXIBI project

FLEXIBI studied the potential of residues from agriâ€“ and horticulture, gardening
and landscaping, as well as from post-consumer wood from peri-urban and urban 
areas as feedstocks for Small-Scale Flexi-Feed Biorefineries (SFB). LEXIBI aims
at designing a decision support tool assessing the different pathway for the 
establishment of SFBs by evaluating all pa-rameters accounting to find
sustainable solutions.

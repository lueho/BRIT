# Interfaces Module

## Overview
The Interfaces module serves as a container for various interfaces between the Bioresource Inventory Tool (BRIT) and external systems, tools, or models. It provides integration points that allow BRIT to exchange data with other software or to implement specialized functionality that bridges BRIT with external resources.

## Structure
The Interfaces module is organized into sub-modules, each representing a specific interface:
- `simucf/` - Interface to the SimuCF (Simulation of Carbon Flows) tool

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this module is to:
- Facilitate data exchange between BRIT and external systems
- Provide specialized interfaces for specific tools or models
- Enable integration of BRIT with the broader ecosystem of bioresource management tools
- Support interoperability with other software in the field

## Integration
The Interfaces module integrates with other BRIT modules by:
- Consuming data from core modules like materials, maps, and inventories
- Providing data transformation and exchange capabilities
- Enabling specialized functionality that extends BRIT's core features

## Usage
This module is used when BRIT needs to interact with external systems or when specialized functionality is required that goes beyond the core features of BRIT. Each sub-module provides its own specific functionality and integration points.
